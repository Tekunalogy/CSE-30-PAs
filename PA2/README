Description
-----------
    This simple program takes a string and writes the string in all upper case
letters to stdout.

How to compile
--------------
    To compile this program, simply navigate to the directory containing the
source files for PA2 and run the following command:
    gcc -g -o allcaps allcaps.s

How to run
----------
    To run the program, type the executable name.  For example:
        ./allcaps

Normal output
-------------
    Normal output is printed to stdout.  An example of normal output would be
the following:
(given the string "hello world! 123 a z ` { A Z")
cs30s220eq@pi-cluster-013:~/PAs/PA2$ ./allcaps
HELLO WORLD! 123 A Z ` { A Z

Abnormal output
---------------
    The only abnormal output is when a string contains '\0' with other 
characters after it. Regardless of input, it always prints to stout.
For example:
(given the string: "123456\078)

cs30s220eq@pi-cluster-013:~/PAs/PA2$ ./allcaps
123456@

Testing
-------

This program was tested manually by replacing the string stored under mesg.
The program indicated no error when all lower case alphabet characters were
transformed to upper case and all other characters were ignored and printed
without modification.

In particular, these inputs were tested on the executable:
  - lower case alphabet
  - upper case alphabet
  - mix of lower case and upper case letters
  - mix of numbers and letters
  - mix of numbers, letters, and special characters
  - null terminator '\0'
  - strings longer than 32 characters
  - '\078' and similar (already described as abnormal output)

Questions
---------

C Question:
5) long x = *(nums + 2);

Terminal Question:
6) ls | wc -l

Academic Integrity Question:
7) Assuming I an unable to debug just by looking at my code. I would comment
every line of my code. That usually helps find some bugs. If I am still unable,
to resolve my issue I would check piazza for any similar issues. If I am unable
to find a post on piazza, I can create one (private if I am showing code). If
not on piazza, I would check if there are tutors available on autograder. If not
on autograder, then I would check if there are professor or tutor office hours.
If none of those resources are available then I would try my best to complete
the assignment myself without searching online or asking anyone inside or
outside the class.
