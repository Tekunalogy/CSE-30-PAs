Q1) Your friend is stressed and asks you for your CSE 30 PA code. 
    How do you convince them to act with integrity?
A1) I would firstly not give my code to them or give them assistance on their PA
    but I would tell them what resources they have available to them, that they
    can use. I would tell them to comment every line of their code. That usually
    helps me find some bugs. They should check piazza for any similar issues. 
    They can create a piazza post (private if showing code). They can check for
    tutors on autograder. They can check if there are professor or tutor office
    hours available. If none of those resources are available then they should
    try their best to complete the assignment themselve without searching online
    or asking anyone.

Q2) We strongly encourage everyone in the class to voice your opinion on the
    class and the instruction team on CAPE, whether they are positive or negative.
    Please fill out your CAPE response for this class.
A2) I have filled out my CAPE response.
